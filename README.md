This document provides all required instructions for any new developer joining the project.
It includes details about what technologies are used, what has been removed for security reasons, and what configuration must be completed before running or deploying the system.

1. Technologies Used

This project is built with:
Frontend

React.js

Vite as the build tool

TailwindCSS for styling

React Router for navigation

Multiple custom UI components (alerts, dialogs, dropdowns, tables, skeleton loaders, etc.)

Backend

Firebase Authentication

Firestore Database

Firebase Storage

Firebase Cloud Functions for admin-level logic and token verification

Other Tools

Environment variable management using .env

Git & GitHub for version control

Firebase CLI for deployments and backend setup

2. Items Removed During Cleanup

The following elements were intentionally removed for security and compliance:
Razorpay Checkout Integration

All Razorpay payment code and references have been removed.

If payments are required later, the new developer must reintegrate Razorpay securely.

Service Account Key File (functions/serviceAccountKey.json)

This file previously contained sensitive credentials and was fully removed from the repository and Git history.

It must never be recreated inside the project folder.

Always generate service keys locally and keep them private.

Firebase Configuration Values

The Firebase initialization file has been cleared to remove all project-specific credentials.

New developers must configure Firebase themselves before the project will run.

3. Developer Requirements Before Running the Project

The new developer must complete the following tasks:

3.1 Create a .env File

Add all Firebase web configuration values into a local environment file.

This file is not included in the repository and must be created manually.

These values can be found in the Firebase Console under Project Settings → Web App.

3.2 Configure Firebase Initialization

Developers must enter the Firebase configuration inside the project's Firebase setup file.

No credentials should ever be hardcoded into the repository.

3.3 Set Up Firebase Cloud Functions

The backend uses Firebase Cloud Functions for actions such as token verification.

Developers must ensure that the Cloud Functions folder includes the required functionality and deploy it using the Firebase CLI.

3.4 Manage Service Account Keys Securely

If a service account key is required for local administrative access:

Generate a new private key from the Firebase Service Accounts section.

Store it securely on your machine.

Do not share it or upload it to GitHub.

4. Development Setup Instructions

New developers must follow these steps:

Install all project dependencies.

Install Firebase CLI globally.

Update the required .env file.

Configure Firebase inside the project.

Set up and deploy Firebase Cloud Functions if backend features are being modified.

Start the local development server using the project's start command.

Follow the current folder and component structure when adding new features.

5. Maintenance & Security Guidelines

Do not upload .env files, private keys, or sensitive data to GitHub.

Ensure all sensitive values are stored in environment variables.

Maintain the modular structure already followed throughout the project.

Document any new functionality, APIs, or environment requirements.

Use proper branching practices when making changes.

Test features locally before pushing to the repository.
